# Optical-Recognition-of-Handwritten-Digits-Dataset-in-Java
Optical character Recognition (OCR) is an important application of machine learning where an algorithm is trained on a data set of known letters/digits and can learn to accurately classify letters/digits using multilayer perceptron algorithm.
Accuracy of 99.8% achieved which is higher than baseline algorithm of euclidean distance(97%).
