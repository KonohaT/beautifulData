Setup Notes: 
Processing can be installed using Maven, as org.processing:core.3.3.7
Some versions of macOS apparently have issues with Processing, due to changes in Java 8. Windows and Linux seem to work fine. 

The Python end requires installation of NumPy and SciPy

The ML model requires training data which is too big for GitHub's size limit, so it's linked here and in a comment in main.py. Place it into the NetworkData folder inside of src (don't ask...).
