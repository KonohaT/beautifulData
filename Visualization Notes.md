Multilayer-Perceptron:

Perceptron (Single layer neural netowork. Multilayer perceptron = neural networks)
If the predicted output is the same as the desired output, its successful
Feed forward neural netowork (No feedbacks, no cycles, no loops)
Multilayer perceptron (A fully connected class of feed forward neural networks)
